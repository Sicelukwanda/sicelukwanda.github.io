Given a single reference image of an object with annotated affordance regions, can we segment semantically corresponding parts within a target scene? Our unsupervised model, AffCorrs, combines the useful properties of pre-trained DINO-ViT's image descriptors and cyclic correspondences. AffCorrs is able to find corresponding affordances both for intra- and inter-class one-shot part segmentation.
