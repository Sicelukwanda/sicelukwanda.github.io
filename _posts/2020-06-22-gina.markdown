In 2016, I worked as a summer intern with Dr. Hujun Yin at the University of Manchester. I developed a mobile video face detection and recognition system on a Raspberry Pi. The system is controlled via speech. It uses Viola-Jones and Eigenface methods for detection and recognition. It is able to actively re-learn and add new faces.

The image shown here is the working prototype. It has shown to be robust to varying light conditions and could be used for a medical assistant robot in the future.
